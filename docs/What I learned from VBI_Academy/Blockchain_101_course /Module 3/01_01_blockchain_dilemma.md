# The blockchain trilemma

Once we understand the underlying knowledge, we will learn the blockchain trilemma.

The blockchain trilemma refers to the widely held belief that, at any given time, decentralized networks can only offer two of the three benefits of decentralization, security, and scalability. 

For example, Ethereum has decentralization and security, but not scalability. Solving this problem is really the domain of layer-one engineers, so we are unlikely to have a strong opinion on which chain truly has the winning technology. But be familiar with this tension, as it will help us better categorize different layer-one projects.
