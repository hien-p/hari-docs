# Data Types in Rust

> Rust is a systems programming language designed with performance, safety, and reliability in mind. One of the foundational concepts that supports these goals is `data typing`. Every value in Rust has a specific `data type`, which helps the compiler understand how that value should behave. 

We will learn about the following data types in rust and understand how they work under the hood:
* Scalar
* Floating point types
* Numeric Operation
* Boolean
* character types
* compound types
