# Hackathon, Grant, and Bounty Platforms


For developers, participating in hackathons is an important way to help us quickly improve our technology, participate in ecological contributions, accumulate project experience, obtain opportunities, enhance communication, integrate into the circle and establish connections.

Hackathons are usually organized by public chain foundations, infrastructure project owners, funds and incubators to enhance brand image, attract more user attention and creative developers to participate in ecosystem construction. There are also investors who participate in order to discover potential talents and projects.
