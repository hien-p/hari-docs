# Welcome to Weminal's Home

Honestly, it is always so hard for me to believe that my dream would come true someday. Challenges do bring growth, which I have experienced quite often recently. Thats the reason why I started this whole blogging thing, cause I want to share the lessons I learned from my journey with you. 

I'm fully aware that this will make it harder for my content to reach people, especially in these day. Especially when I'm just a 23-year-old average dude with no big achievements to his name yet.

But there is something about reading that has always fascinated me. You can watch a TikTok reel or listening to a podcast while driving or cooking. You can pay half of your attention to these things and still get something out of it. But you can not be half-ass about reading. Words are boring and harder to follow, so if you want to get something out of it, you have to fully concentrate. You have to use your imagination and be very mindful about it.

Thats why I chose this format. I want my readers to participate with me, to actively think while reading my stuffs. And I want to be surrounded by the type of people who enjoy that activity. So if you are reading this, you are exactly who I want to be here. 


Thank you a lot, and I wish yor with lots of growth and good challenges. We will see each other soon in 2025 🙏💚
